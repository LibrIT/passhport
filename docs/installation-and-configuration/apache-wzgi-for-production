Add a WSGI server in front of PaSSHport

PaSSHport is based on Flask, the builtin web server can handle only one request at a time. It means that you can't really use it in production environnement...

In order to handle more requests, we duplicate the PaSSHport for every connection. Apache provides such a solution with WSGI... And it's quite easy to activate it.

Installation

apt install apache2 libapache2-mod-wsgi-py3
 
Configuration

Create a new apache vhost file with this content:

Listen 5000:
<VirtualHost *:5000>
    ServerName passhport

    WSGIDaemonProcess passhport user=passhport group=passhport threads=5
    WSGIScriptAlias / /home/passhport/passhport/tools/passhportd.wsgi

    <Directory /home/passhport/ >
        WSGIProcessGroup passhport
        WSGIApplicationGroup %{GLOBAL}
        # passhportd don't provides authentication, please filter by IP
        Require ip 127.0.0.1
    </Directory>
</VirtualHost>

then deactivate default website and activate this one:
a2dissite 000-default
a2ensite passhport.conf
systemctl restart apache2

and Voilà.
